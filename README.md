# SDN-Balancer
Comprises of the load balancer of SDN

Here, you'll find the topology script which can used be used in any SDN. I've worked on this during my summer internship of research and work on SDN.
This script was used in MININET for executing the Balancer algorithm. The load balancer is still not finished yet (it will be uploaded soon).
For more information regarding this you can visit my blog on the internship (Link attached).

Also, this project is highly inspired by work of Nayan Sheth on load balancer, I've used his script as a reference to build mine. So thanks to him.
This is the first time I've worked with SDN, so the scripts might not be perfect as it is like a prototype. 

> Topology is uploaded, Loadbalancer script still has some work left (so it will be uploaded soon)
