# SDN-Balancer
Comprises of the load balancer of SDN

Here, you'll find the topology script which can used be used in any SDN. I've worked on this during my summer internship of research and work on SDN.
This script was used in MININET for executing the Balancer algorithm. The load balancer is still not finished yet (it will be uploaded soon).
For more information regarding this you can visit my blog on the internship (Link attached).

Also, this project is highly inspired by work of Nayan Sheth on load balancer, I've used his script as a reference to build mine. So thanks to him.
This is the first time I've worked with SDN, so the script is not perfect as it is like a prototype. 

This balancer is not complete, after extensive research and studying/understanding a few balancer codes, this code has been made by the major help of Load Balancer created by Nayan Seth.

> This was my first experience in SDN, the code is not complete it still needs some wroking on, I tried to implement whatever I had learnt during the internship time.
